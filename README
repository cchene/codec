Java binary data codecs

  A collection of high-performance binary data codecs:

    Base16    - AKA hex
    Base64    - standard base64
    Base64Url - URL-safe base64

  The Base64 codec is designed to handle base64 without line splitting
  and with optional padding. Alternative character tables may be supplied
  to implement modified base64 schemes such as the URL-safe variant.
